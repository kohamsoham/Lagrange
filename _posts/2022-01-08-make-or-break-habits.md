Reflex actions do not involve conscious thinking - imagine a kid putting a finger on a flame and pulling it back. Habits on the other hand are *soft* reflex actions ranging from conscious effort when starting out (learning to drive) to automatic (expert driver).  The main question addressed in [this podcast]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g) is how to form new (good) habits and break bad old habits. I’ve tried to crisply summarize the main ideas and draw comparisons with Ayurvedic view of the world. 

The measure of a habit’s strength are its context-independence (doesn’t need the same environment) and minimal friction in doing the habit even when we may not like it much. To achieve high strength of a habit, one can try the following: 

- Procedural memory visualization - of the habit as a sequence of specific steps in the mind’s eye.
- Task bracketing - Activate the beginning and end of a habit marker in the dorsal striatum is best done during the first phase of the day (first eight hours of the day)
- Habit strengthening - Habits that are already there and are sort of mellow could be considered in the second phase of the day (second eight hours).
- Habit creation - Rest and recovery for rewiring the brain are needed (the last eight hours of the day).
- Reward prediction error - Think about events that precede or succeed the habit.
- Use 21 day system for 6 new habits - **Key idea: Improve the habit of forming habits! Recursive meta definition**
    - 6 new habits for 21 days
    - Nothing new for 21 days - reinforce the 6 new habits
    - Allow failures - no super compensation
    - Consistency is the key

To weaken the strength of a habit, we need to actively weaken the connections of the neurons. Notifications, punishments, etc. don’t help much without monitoring. To this end, one can: 

- Link a bad habit to a good habit by doing the good habit after the bad habit’s execution.
- This creates space between the habit’s trigger and the reaction and allows us to intervene.
