Donella Meadows wrote an [article](https://www.bfi.org/sites/default/files/attachments/pages/PlacesInterveneSystem-Meadows.pdf) on leverage points on where to intervene in a system. The objective being to influence the system towards some behavior that is better than the current state; with the the infleuncer being an individual with some stake in the system. People have intuitive understanding of where to intervene but  complex systems are counter-intuitive. This note aims to summarize the key points from Donella's article and draws some comparisons with control systems. 

1. Parameters are the least useful. If there is a bath-tub hole in the system, irrespective of the flow-rates, water will be wasted. They are useful, however, if they kick the system like a phase transition. Delay is most useful - both in the freshness of measured signal and the immediacy of the response. Delay is most useful - in comparison to the rate of change in the system. However, delay may not be controllable but might be a feature of the system! 
2. Buffer -  a large stock stabilizes the system, but makes it difficult to respond quickly. The leverage point is the correct buffer sizing at design time. Too high, low response. Too low, too unstable. Typically, physical. 
3. Negative feedback loops - Removing negative loops due to cost or their lack of usage renders the system prone to catastrophes. Strength of the negative feedback to keep the system stable depends upon parameters, delays, responses, etc. It is important relative to the magnitude of the change in the system the feedback is expected to stabilize. 
4. Positive feedback loops - Usually they don’t grow beyond a level because negative growth rates kick in eventually in physical systems - e.g., unbridled profits attract competition. However, the leverage point is to reduce the gain constant, and not another negative loop. 
5. Information flows - visibility into consumption can reduce consumption (e.g., electricity meters in sight). To avoid tragedy of commons, have high price when resource dips badly to convey the cost. 
6. Rules of the game - Affect everything but problem is they are designed to help the already powerful - typically the corporations. 
7. Self-organization - Most powerful idea - immune system, human brain, etc. Simple rules can evolve into complex diverse outcomes. Human DNA is quite simple in number of units and rules. Can be used to encourage diversity - but people don’t want this due to lack of control. 
8. Goals of the system - People within do not understand the bigger picture. Higher the hierarchy, the more altruistic the goal shoud be. Articulating a goal well - a la Reagan - can really change 
9. Mindset from which the system came - Kind of like how quantum mechanics replaces netwonian mechanics. Whole new way of seeing things. Can be done by pointing out old limitations while showing how new one does better.
