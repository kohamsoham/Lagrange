# A good information diet 
Zombies are out to get you.You have a limited supply of magic pills that you need to keep consuming to keep you from becoming one. If you lose your pills to the zombies, you become a zombie. Far fetched? Hell, no!  Turns out your ability to focus and create with purpose is your supply of pills; and the zombies are all the forms of physical and digital distractions (no, I didn't mean your family) that aim to grab your attention.This piece is about my ideas on making good use of my personal supply of the magic pills and making new ones. 

I used to wonder why many well-used online products were free, when even basic things are not. The middle-class me was happy that I was using "cheap and best" online products. Only later did I realize that data from our activity is the raw-material for their money-printing ML monster algorithms. I mostly escaped the Facebook mania after an initial school group, but was ensnared by Twitter for a long time. The real-time data feeds, incisive and pithy observations, smart-ass ripostes, and gotcha touches still have their charm. However, some alarm bells have belatedly and faintly started ringing in my head that I have been suckered into mostly wasting my attention. For introverts like me, observing and expressing online can be particularly addictive. You feel like you belong to something and gain useful information by just scrolling without doing the hardwork of reading a good book or having a real-world conversation. Specifically, I realized that I had the following problems:

- Even as I kept buying e/physical books regularly, I was hardly reading them on a regular basis. 
- Even if I read things, my ability to retain information was lower than what I was used to. 
- Even if retained the info, I wasn't using the retained information effectively. 

After some thought, I realized that I was on a very poor *information diet*. Basically, most of the information that I consumed on Twitter and on whatsapp was pointless. Some were *really* good, but most was junk. Like diamond prospectors, I was trawling through dirt in the hope for the right diamond when all the diamonds I needed were right in my bookshelf and kindle. Just like junk food is bad for my body, junk info is bad for my mind.


**The information pyramid**

My colleagues and I had a [paper ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311651891_Sense_and_sensibility_-_The_utility_of_HVAC_sensors_for_large_zones)on the usefulness of sensory information in engineering systems. With some amusement, I realized I should eat my dog-food. Here's my attempt at classifying information like a food pyramid on the basis of *usefulness* 

1. Short-term high and long-term dangerous (sugars)
2. Short-term useful and long-term useless (complex carbs/fats)
3. Short-term potentially useless, and long-term very useful to *create* (proteins) that make muscles, brain cells, etc.)

Note that the brain needs to spend it's limited time and energy in acquiring and processing information irrespective of the category. Therefore, I figured out like most of the optimization in research, I should spend brain-power (the magic pills) to acquire and process information to maximise the bang for the buck in the following ways. 

**Using the information pyramid**

Once I started seeing information as food for the mind, it became reasonably straight-forward: 

1. Eliminate sugars. Most news comes here. If it's really useful news that'll affect you (e.g., some new tax law that really affects you), it'll percolate to you eventually. I quit reading newspapers thanks to social media ripping apart the main-stream media. Now, I guess I'll aim to quit Twitter (I'm not on anything else) or at least strongly limit my usage of the site. Once in a while a sweet is ok (I am particularly partial to gulab jamuns), similarly, I reckon junk information is ok *only* once in a while.  
2. Carbs and fats in moderation - Most information needed to function routinely comes here. Things like finding a route, shopping for good deals online, etc. Some amount of time, some degree of automation, to acquire and use this information, is ok but this can't be one's main source of information diet. 
3. Proteins in abundance - Good quality information (not necessarily paid for) that can be useful in *creating* things. For example, things like a useful course, or for me, how to set-up this blog for me to write. The beauty of the Internet is that information that was once  scarce is abundant and ridiculously cheap. The price you pay in acquiring it is your attention. So you want to pay the price in attention, and reap the benefits, by creating something new with the information. 

**Using information to create**

When you acquire information to create (the proteins), the key analogies with food I could think of are:

- Learn to identify proteins. When is the information high-quality? This is something that's specific to what your goals are in learning something to create. But, here's a check-list I came up with: 
    - Teaches you something new (e.g., math skills, philosophical observations for life, Python programming, etc.)
    - Surprises you with something non-obvious (e.g, ideas that expose human biases, paradoxes, fallacies, etc.) 
    - Is well-structured even if dense (e.g, an author making excellent effort to explain)
    - Reinforces with analogies (e.g., visual representations of math)
    - Explains what you know even better (e.g., a different perspective of the same thing) 
    - **In brief: Is the output of some good creative process and can be the input for your personal creativity**

- Proteins are useful in conjunction with exercise to build muscle. Likewise, even the most high-quality information will *really* stick and enrich your mind and its abilities; combine with other ideas; and produce new creative ideas, only when you try to use it consciously or (in most research ideas) sub-consciously. Till this happens, it makes sense to use external repositories (e.g., notion, evernote, github blogs, etc.) to store it, so you can reinforce it in your head every now and then.  


Finally, creating something new from what you know is how you make new magic pills. If you think of it, the pills are real - they are the standard neuro-transmitters for the moods in your brain -  and the zombies are also real - the attention economy is ALL about controlling what is really something deeply personal - *your* attention.
